# Bachelor's Program

:::note
As is common in universities, you can largely choose for yourself which semester you want to take which module. However, there is a [recommended study plan](https://www.bio.ifi.lmu.de/bim/studium/studium/plans/studienplane/) that is intended to make planning your studies as easy as possible. The semester information in the following sections is based on this study plan.
:::

The Bachelor's program divides its modules into three blocks:

## Biology/Chemistry/Biochemistry

Here you have to further distinguish between biology and biochemistry.

Biology is exclusively taught in the first and second semesters. You receive a broad overview of the various areas of biology, from cells to ecosystems. The lecture is based on the [Purves](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-58172-8) - however, it is not necessary to buy the book.

In parallel, _Organic Chemistry_ is scheduled for the first semester. This module is intended to bring students with different prior knowledge to the same level. After that, you have a biochemistry module every semester up to and including the fourth semester. In the fifth semester, the biochemistry block concludes with the _Laboratory Course in Molecular Biology & Biochemistry_. Here you spend several days in a molecular biology laboratory and conduct biological experiments yourself.

## Computer Science/Mathematics/Statistics

You can complete this block entirely at either LMU or TUM. The decision is usually made at the beginning of the first semester of study. During the freshman days, the student council provides enough information about the advantages and disadvantages of both options to make this decision well.


:::note
You can still switch afterwards without any problems, as long as you have not successfully completed an examination at one of the two universities in the _Computer Science/Mathematics/Statistics_ block. After that, you may still be able to switch, but it involves some bureaucratic effort. The student council can help in this case.
:::

Regardless of which university you choose, you have one module from each of the following areas:

- Analysis
- Linear Algebra
- Discrete Structures
- Statistics

- Introduction to Programming/Computer Science
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Databases
- Theoretical Computer Science

Depending on the university, the modules from the same area are distributed differently across the first four semesters.
No modules from this block are scheduled for the fifth and sixth semesters.

## Bioinformatics

This block helps to connect the basics from _Biology/Chemistry/Biochemistry_ and _Computer Science/Mathematics/Statistics_ and apply them to real problems.

In the first two semesters, this happens in the form of the modules _Introduction to Bioinformatics_ 1 and 2.

In the second and third semesters, you additionally have the first project-based module _Problem-Based Learning_.
There are several instances of this, covering different areas of bioinformatics.
To simplify the choice between the different instances, the student council usually organizes an information event in good time.

The _Programming Lab Bioinformatics_ takes place in the third semester. This module consists of smaller assignments throughout the semester and an intensive block part at the beginning of the lecture-free period.

The modules _Algorithmic Bioinformatics_ 1 and 2 are scheduled for the fourth and fifth semesters. Here, concepts from theoretical computer science are applied to biological problems.

In the fifth semester, the _Genome-Oriented Bioinformatics Lab_ is added. For this module, as for the module _Problem-Based Learning_, there are several instances, as well as an information event organized by the student council.

:::caution
For the _Genome-Oriented Bioinformatics Lab_, it is an admission requirement that you have successfully completed the _Programming Lab Bioinformatics_.
:::

The module _Practical Work_ is intended as preparation for the final thesis, lasts two months, and is usually completed at the same chair as the final thesis. The final thesis itself lasts four months. These two modules are scheduled for the sixth semester.

## Elective Modules

Unfortunately, only 6 ECTS are provided for elective modules in the Bachelor's program. According to the recommended study plan, the sixth semester is intended for this. Since not all modules are offered in the summer semester, many students take this module in the fifth or even the seventh semester.

An overview of the approved elective modules can be found [here](https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/studium/studiengaenge/bachelor-bioinformatik/modulkatalog/#:~:text=12-,Wahlveranstaltungen,-(Pr%C3%BCfungsordnung%202021)).

# Master's Program

In stark contrast to the Bachelor's program, there are hardly any compulsory courses in the Master's program.
Only the Master's thesis and the module _Master Lab Bioinformatics_ are mandatory.
Beyond that, there are three areas from which you must contribute a certain ECTS minimum:

- Methods and Research: 33 ECTS
- Theory Computer Science, Mathematics and Statistics: 15 ECTS
- Theory Biology/Biochemistry/Chemistry: 15 ECTS

Additionally, you can contribute any number of ECTS from elective modules within the same three areas, so that including the Master's thesis and the Master Lab, you reach 120 ECTS.
For the elective modules, you can choose from both the LMU and TUM module catalogs.

A current overview of the approved elective modules can be found [here](https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/studium/studiengaenge/master-bioinformatik/modulkatalog/). The approval of new elective modules can be requested from the examination board.
