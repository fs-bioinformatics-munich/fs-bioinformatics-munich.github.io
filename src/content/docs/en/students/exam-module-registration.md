title: "Exam and Module Registration"
---

As a bioinformatics student in Munich, you can take modules at both TUM and LMU. The registration process for modules and exams works somewhat differently depending on which university offers the module.

# Modules at TUM

Fortunately, TUM has only one portal through which exam and module registrations are managed: TUMonline. Course registrations are usually opened at the latest one week before the semester begins. For some modules, however, registration may open significantly earlier.
For some modules (exclusively elective modules, especially in the Master's program), there is a registration limit. If this limit is reached, no further registration is possible. In these cases, you should inform yourself early about the start of the registration period.

After registering for a lecture, you will usually be added directly to the Moodle course.

Exam registrations typically open from early to mid-January for the winter semester and from early to mid-July for the summer semester.

# Modules at LMU

LMU is currently planning to switch to the same system that TUM uses for campus management. However, this may take some time. Until then, modules will continue to be managed mainly through Moodle and partly through LSF.

## Course Registration

This varies somewhat depending on the module. For most modules, registration in the respective Moodle course is sufficient. The enrollment keys are sometimes provided directly in the Moodle course description and sometimes on the website of the department offering the course.

Some modules (exclusively in Biology/Chemistry) still use LSF for exam registration.

## Exam Registration

Since our grades are managed by TUM, registration through TUMonline is required for every examination. This also applies to LMU modules.
However, since LMU usually does not receive information about registrations on TUMonline, double registration is required for most LMU modules: once on TUMonline and once on LMU Moodle.
Normally, the LMU student ID is required for identification at LMU exams.

There are exceptions, however: For some biochemistry modules, registration via TUMonline is sufficient. In this case, the TUM student ID is required. This is usually communicated early enough by the lecturers.

# Labs and Seminars

For labs and seminars, there are always multiple instances. To make the allocation as convenient as possible, there is a two-step procedure:

- Needs assessment: This is only to determine how many students want to take the lab/seminar
- Registration: Here you can indicate which instances you prefer. Subsequently, the places are distributed in such a way that the preferences of as many students as possible are fulfilled.

Additional registration via TUMonline is not always possible/required in all cases. If in doubt, ask the module coordinator/instance coordinator.
