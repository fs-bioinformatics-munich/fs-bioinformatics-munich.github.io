Here are step-by-step instructions on switching from Bachelor to Master in Bioinformatics when you have not fully completed your Bachelor yet (i.e., you have >= 150 ECTS in your transcript of records and will finish soon).

## Prerequisites

You must be matriculated for the next semester, i.e., your fees must be paid, and it has to be shown in the system.

## Deadlines

- **15 July** for the winter semester
- **15 January** for the summer semester

## Application Process

1. **General Information**: Visit the [Master's program website](https://www.bio.ifi.lmu.de/studium/studiengaenge_bioinformatik/master/index.html) for general information about this process.

2. **Submit Documents**: Submit your documents to the [registration site](https://www.bio.ifi.lmu.de/studium/studiengaenge_bioinformatik/efv-anmeldung/index.html). The submission fields disappear when the deadline is over.

### Required Documents

- Your CV
- Your "Abitur" certificate or an equivalent document that enables you to study at a German university
- Your Bachelor's degree in Bioinformatics (or equivalent), including a grade point average **OR** if a certificate of your Bachelor's degree is not available at the time of application, your current Transcript of Records (e.g., from TUMonline)
- An essay (German or English) of up to 1,000 words on "Why am I able to and why do I want to study Bioinformatics"

## After Acceptance

1. **Acceptance Letter**: Once you get accepted, you receive a letter or an e-mail containing a PDF confirming that you can be enrolled in the Master. The information for the next steps can be found [here](https://www.lmu.de/de/workspace-fuer-studierende/1x1-des-studiums/fachwechsel/index.html).

2. **Statement from Mrs. van Gemert**: Because you do not have your degree certificate yet, you have to write an e-mail to Mrs. van Gemert to get a statement confirming that the required credits will be completed within one year. The statement should confirm: *"Falls bei Antragstellung noch Pr체fungsleistungen ausstehen, die erst zu einem Folgesemester erbracht sein werden, ist statt des Zeugnisses eine Stellungnahme des zust채ndigen Pr체fungsausschusses vorzulegen, wonach alle f체r den Bachelorabschluss erforderlichen Leistungen absehbar binnen eines Jahres erbracht sein werden."* Make sure you write Mrs. von Gemert with your TUM mail address so the mail does not get lost.

3. **Request Subject Change**: Now, you must request the switch from Bachelor to Master at the Studentenkanzlei LMU. You can either send it via mail or e-mail to `FW.Studentenkanzlei@verwaltung.uni-muenchen.de`. Please make sure you write from your LMU mail address; they will delete it otherwise.

### Include in Your Request

- Request form
- The letter from Mrs. van Gemert
- The PDF acceptance letter

**Important**: The size of your email attachment cannot exceed 5 MB, and everything must be sent in one single email only.

## Final Steps

1. **Confirmation**: You will receive confirmation mail that you have successfully changed the subject!

2. **Provisional Enrollment**: You will receive a letter that tells you that you were only matriculated in the Master under reserve (*unter Vorbehalt*). You sign a document in which you promise to hand your Bachelor's certificate in as soon as you receive it and send it back.
