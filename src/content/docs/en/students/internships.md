title: "Internships"
---

Although we don't have mandatory internships outside the university in our curriculum, such an experience can be very beneficial.
Internships allow you to apply theoretical concepts from your studies in practice and engage with the working world.

If an internship takes place during the lecture-free period, no further bureaucratic steps are necessary.
However, if the internship substantially overlaps with the lecture period, it may be advisable to take a leave of absence for the duration of the internship.

# Leave of Absence

Through leave semesters, ECTS hurdles are frozen for the duration of the leave.
As with all matters related to enrollment, LMU is responsible for leaves of absence.

Specifically, the following documents are required:

- [Application form](https://cms-cdn.lmu.de/media/lmu/downloads/studentenkanzlei/antrag_beurlaubung-mit-studiengangsangaben_zweisprachig.pdf)
- Expert opinion from the institute management, [Career Service](https://www.s-a.uni-muenchen.de/index.html), or academic advisor that recommends the completion of the internship with justification (copy)
  - In our case, the academic advisor is [Professor Heun](https://www.bio.ifi.lmu.de/mitarbeiter/volker-heun/)
- Internship contract (copy)

The documents can be sent by mail or email to LMU's Student Office.
- Mail: Drop the letter in the internal mailbox at the main entrance of LMU (address it to the Student Office)
- Email: [BU.Studentenkanzlei@verwaltung.uni-muenchen.de](mailto:BU.Studentenkanzlei@verwaltung.uni-muenchen.de)
