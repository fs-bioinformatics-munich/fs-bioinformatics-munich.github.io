title: "Leave of Absence"
---

A leave of absence pauses certain study obligations for a semester. During a leave semester, ECTS progression requirements are effectively frozen.

Key points (summary):

- Application is per semester. You must apply separately for each semester of leave.
- Deadlines: by October 30 (winter term) and April 30 (summer term). Late applications are only possible if the reason arose unexpectedly during the semester.
- Fees and re-enrollment: student union fees must be booked in your account and re-enrollment for the relevant semester must be completed.
- Submission: by post or by email from your LMU campus email address to the Student Office. Email submissions must be a single email with all documents and ≤ 5 MB total.
- Study and exams: as a rule, study and exam performance at LMU is not permitted during leave semesters. Exceptions apply for maternity protection, parental leave, or care time. Retake deadlines continue to run unless formally extended by the examination office.

Common reasons (examples):

- Illness (doctor’s certificate required; after exceeding standard study period, a specialist report may be needed)
- Study abroad (proof of admission/immatriculation; Erasmus confirmation may suffice)
- Voluntary internships not linked to LMU/TUM modules (a leave semester may be appropriate; confirm eligibility and documents with the Student Office)
- Maternity protection and parental leave (MuSchG / BEEG)
- Extraordinary burden due to care of close relatives (proof required)
- Other reasons (only after strict individual assessment; economic reasons are not sufficient)

How to apply (documents):

- Application form: https://cms-cdn.lmu.de/media/lmu/downloads/studentenkanzlei/antrag_beurlaubung-mit-studiengangsangaben_zweisprachig.pdf
- Additional confirmations depend on the reason (see examples above). Always check the official page for the current list.

Contact / submission address (Student Office):

- Post: place documents in the internal mailbox at LMU’s main entrance (address to the Student Office)
- Email: BU.Studentenkanzlei@verwaltung.uni-muenchen.de (from your LMU campus address only)
