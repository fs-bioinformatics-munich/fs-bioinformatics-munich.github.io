# General (Bachelor and Master)

## Repeating Examinations

Examinations can be repeated as many times as needed until passed. There is no limit to the number of attempts. Once an examination has been passed, it cannot be repeated.

## Approval of New Elective Modules

The approval of new elective modules must be requested from the examination board. To check the suitability of the module beforehand, it is advisable to contact the following offices before submitting the application:

- LMU modules: [Prof. Heun](https://www.bio.ifi.lmu.de/mitarbeiter/volker-heun/)
- TUM modules: [Lothar Richter](https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/visitenkarte.show_vcard?pPersonenId=5EF707BE9C00EBCE&pPersonenGruppe=3)

# Bachelor

The complete, current examination regulations can be found [here](https://www.tum.de/fileadmin/user_upload_87/gi32rab/FPSO/Bioinformatik_BA_LF_AS_16122021.pdf). For students, the version of the examination regulations that was the most current at the beginning of their studies always applies. Conceptually, the examination regulations represent an extension of the [TUM's General Academic and Examination Regulations (APSO)](https://portal.mytum.de/archiv/kompendium_rechtsangelegenheiten/apso/folder_listing). These also apply to bioinformatics students in modules offered by LMU. Therefore, it may happen that different rules apply to bioinformatics students in LMU modules than to the majority of students taking the respective module.
