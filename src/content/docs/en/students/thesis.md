# How to Find a Supervisor?

# Formal Rules

The rules are described in detail [here](https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/studium/studiengaenge/bachelor-bioinformatik/praktische-arbeit-bachelorarbeit/).

Additionally, here are a few tips:

## Submission

### How Many Copies Should I Print?

Theoretically, only one printed copy of the thesis is needed. This can either be sent by mail or submitted directly at the Mathematics/Computer Science building of TUM. Details about this are explained [here](https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/studium/studiengaenge/bachelor-bioinformatik/praktische-arbeit-bachelorarbeit/#:~:text=m%C3%BCssen%20paginiert%20sein.-,Abgabe,-Ein%20Exemplar%20Ihrer).

It is advisable to clarify in good time with the first and second examiners whether they would like to have a printed version of the thesis. Some examiners want a printed version, others are satisfied with a digital version.

Furthermore, you can of course also print a copy for yourself. This is up to each individual.

# Best Practices

## Print Shops

Many bioinformatics students print at [printy](https://www.printy.de/en/). Our exact print configuration is already known there.

Other print shops where students have had good experiences:

- [Copy-Oase](https://www.copy-oase.com/Willkommen.html)
    - Relatively inexpensive
- [Student Council EI](https://www.fs.ei.tum.de/services/druckabs/)
    - Location: TUM Main Campus, North Campus
    - Very inexpensive
    - Familiar with the requirements of the Computer Science Faculty
    - You don't have to fill out the submission form, you can just go there
- [Student Council MPIC](https://mpic.fs.tum.de/services/abschlussarbeiten/)
    - Location: TUM Campus Garching
    - Otherwise similar to Student Council EI
